This module of iFace is implements classes and methods related to profile of users. Information about users, friendship, activity history (storytelling) are some of the features of this module.

The Profile module allow the user to customize your account containing personal and professional information, such as name, date of birth, gender, phone numbers and relationship status (single, married, etc). It's possible for the user to classify other users such as family members or maybe informing workplaces and / or academics where she attends, home town and city where she lives.  If a relationship status informed involve another user, that user will also assume the same status, showing who is the user involved.

This module also enables an user to send friend requests to other users, and they may accept, reject or ignore this request. It allows the users to block other users. A blocked user can't send friendship requests for who blocked her.

The history of all activities performed by the users is registered by this module. An activity can be, for example, an interaction with a forum, one checkin held somewhere, a friendship request sent to another user or even a change in the own profile.
